# Code Off - JSinSA Tweet Visualiser
This code off challenges all attendees of the 2016 [JS in SA conference](http://jsinsa.com) to use their creativity to make a tweet visualiser. Your visualiser may be statistical, filled with wacky animations, or even three dimensional. It's all up to you!
This repository contains boilerplate code to fetch tweets with the @JSinSA handle and #JSinSA hashtags - so that part is done.

## Prize
The creator of the winning visualiser will walk away with a Nespresso Lattissima Touch Glam coffee machine.
The winner will be determined by a panel of judges at the JS in SA conference on 16 July 2016 at 16:00.

## Inspiration
To get you going, have a look at these three JavaScript libraries that can be used in different ways to do something cool with the tweets. You're not restricted to using any of these, but they may be a good source for inspiration.
